# Tales of Dry Lands: Chronicles of Drought

<p class="message">Welcome to our interactive journey into the world of drought data! üå°Ô∏èüíß<p>

We‚Äôre thrilled to have you embark on this adventure with us. Whether you‚Äôre a student, a curious newcomer or a passionate environmentalist, our mission is to make the complexities of drought data understandable and engaging for you. 

Feel free to explore at your own pace: we only ask that you have a basic knowledge of Python, we'll take care of the rest.

Are you new to studying climate data? If so, we recommend starting with the [Climate toolkit for beginners](chapters/01-climate-toolkit-for-beginners/what-is-climate), which will provide you with all the general knowledge you need to embark on this journey. 
Or do you already feel confident about these topics? Dive right into the [Drought focus](chapters/02-drought-focus/index) chapter and start your analysis.

We hope to provide not just knowledge, but also inspiration as you delve into the critical challenges and fascinating aspects of climate data. Welcome aboard!
