# notebook 1

1. Purpose of the notebook
- Explain the objective of the notebook, which is to recognize drought events around the world and over time.


3. Variables of interest
- brief description of the specific variables in the dataset that will be used for analysis.
-Data quality and limits (if there are any).

4. Setting up the environment
-Required libraries: list and explain the Python libraries needed (numpy, pandas, xarray, plotly, cartopy, earthkit).
I-nstallation guide: provide instructions or commands to install these libraries.

5. Data loading and preprocessing
- Get the data: what is CDS and how to download the data from it.
- Loading data: demonstrate how to load netCDF files using xarray.
- Data inspection: show how to inspect the structure of the dataset, including dimensions, variables, and metadata.
- Preprocessing steps: detail any necessary steps to clean or manipulate the data for analysis.

6. Understanding drought indices
In depth explanation of SPI and SPEI indices, the different time windows (1, 3, 6, 12, 48 months), how they are calculated and their range indicators.

7. Analyzing drought trends
Selecting a year and region: guide on how to select specific years and regions for analysis.
Visualization: instructions on how to create visualizations (maps and time series plots) to represent the drought severity and its geographical spread.
Interpretation of results: help the reader understand what the visualizations indicate about drought conditions.

8. Interactive elements
Interactive maps: include interactive maps to explore different years and regions.
Sliders for year selection: allow users to select different years using sliders to dynamically update visualizations.
