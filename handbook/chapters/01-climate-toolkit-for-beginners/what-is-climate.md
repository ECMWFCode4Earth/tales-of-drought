# What is climate?

The terms "**climate**" and "**weather**" are often used interchangeably, but they hold distinctly different meanings for climate scientists. 

*Weather* describes atmospheric conditions over short periods, typically spanning hours to days. 

In contrast, **climate** refers to the average behavior of the atmosphere over much longer periods, ranging from years to decades, and sometimes even centuries. Typically, climatologists use a **30-year period** as a standard to gather robust statistics and maintain stable climate conditions.

Between the scales of weather and climate lies the concept of **climate variability**, also known as climate **anomaly**. This measures the deviations of a particular season's or year's condition from the climatological average for that period.

The choice of data — whether focusing on weather, climate or climate variability — depends on the specific research question being addressed. For our drought analysis, we will consider only climate and climate variability data.

## Climate variables and indicators

What factors allow us to understand the climate and recognize changes in it? 

A panel of meteorologists and climate scientists from around the world has identified 55 **Essential Climate Variables** (ECVs). These variables are consistently monitored to capture a detailed picture of Earth's climate.

Additionally to these variables, there is a select number of **Climate Indicators**. These indicators offer crucial insights into the most significant aspects of climate change, helping us understand its impact across various domains.
