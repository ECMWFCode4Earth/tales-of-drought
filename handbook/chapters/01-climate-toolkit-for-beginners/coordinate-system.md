# The Earth's coordinate system


Understanding climate data requires familiarity with how our planet is geographically mapped. Let's visualize the Earth as a sphere. To pinpoint any location in a universally accepted way, we use a system of coordinates.

## Meridians and longitude

Imagine drawing invisible lines vertically from the North Pole to the South Pole at regular intervals. These lines, called **meridians**, connect the poles. Each meridian has an associated constant value known as **longitude**, which is measured in degrees. 

By convention, the **Prime Meridian**, which is set at 0° longitude, runs through the [Royal Observatory in Greenwich](https://www.rmg.co.uk/royal-observatory), United Kingdom.

Longitude values on Earth are marked from the Prime Meridian. They decrease westward up to -180° and increase eastward up to 180°.

## Paralles and latitude

Now that we've established a universal method for determining the east-west position on Earth, let's explore how we define positions from north to south. Imagine drawing a line around the Earth that is equidistant from both poles, stretching from east to west. This line is called the **Equator**. Lines running parallel to the Equator are known as **parallels**.

The position of these parallels is determined by their angle relative to the horizontal plane passing through the Equator. This angle is referred to as **latitude**, which is also measured in degrees. Latitude values increase from the Equator northward up to 90° and decrease southward down to -90°.

This system allows us to specify any location on Earth using a universally understood method.

However, when dealing with climate data, it's crucial to remember that climate is influenced not only by the Earth surface, but also by atmospheric conditions. Therefore, to gain a comprehensive understanding of our planet's climate, we must consider a more complex representation. We will explore this further in the next chapter.
