# notebook 1

## Purpose of the notebook
Explain the objective of the notebook, which is to recognize drought events around the world and over time.


## Indicators of interest
- brief description of the specific variables in the dataset that will be used for analysis.
- Data quality and limits (if there are any).


## Data loading and preprocessing
- Get the data
- Loading data
- Data inspection: show how to inspect the structure of the dataset, including dimensions, variables, and metadata.
- Preprocessing steps: detail any necessary steps to clean or manipulate the data for analysis.


## Selecting a year to explore
This segment will be designed as an interactive feature within the notebook where the audience can choose a specific year from the dataset to analyze. A dropdown menu or slider will be used for year selection. This interactive element will allow users to personalize the data exploration to their interests or specific years they might be curious about, such as years of significant global events like El Niño.

### Technical implementation
Utilize Python libraries like ipywidgets for interactive controls.
Upon selection, the notebook will dynamically load and process SPEI data for that particular year, preparing it for visualization and further analysis in subsequent sections.


## Mapping drought globally
Once a year is selected, this section will generate a visual representation—typically a global map—illustrating the SPEI values across different regions. The map will use a color gradient to show varying degrees of drought severity; for instance, deep red will indicate extreme drought, while blue might indicate normal or wet conditions. The purpose here is to provide a clear, at-a-glance understanding of how different parts of the world were affected by drought in the selected year.

### Technical implementation
Use mapping libraries to create the global map.
Overlay SPEI data onto the map, using color coding to represent different drought intensities.


## Deep dive into specific regions
In this segment, the notebook will offer a closer look at specific regions that either experienced significant drought conditions or where drought had notable impacts on human or ecological systems during the selected year. This will involve a comparative analysis of regions with severe drought versus those with mild or no drought. The narrative might explore factors contributing to the drought, such as lack of rainfall, high temperatures, and the consequent effects on local agriculture, water supply, and socio-economic conditions.

### Technical implementation:
Allow users to select regions on the global map for a more detailed analysis.
Display localized SPEI data and possibly integrate other data types (e.g., agricultural yield or water reservoir levels) to paint a fuller picture of impacts.


## Comparison over time
This feature will enable users to understand how drought conditions have changed over time by comparing SPEI data between different years. Users will select another year to compare side-by-side with the initially selected year. This comparison will help illustrate trends such as the increasing frequency of droughts or shifts in drought-prone areas, potentially linking these patterns to broader climatic changes like global warming.

### Technical implementation:
Implement additional interactive controls to select a second year for comparison.
Use side-by-side or overlaid maps to visually compare drought conditions across the two selected years.
Optionally, statistical analysis will be performed to quantitatively describe changes in drought severity and coverage.


## Distribution of drought conditions
Histograms will be used to show the distribution of SPEI scores across different regions or globally in the selected year. This will help illustrate how widespread severe drought conditions were and identify the most commonly occurring drought severity levels.

### Technical implementation:
Calculate the frequency of different SPEI categories (e.g., mild, moderate, severe, extreme) and plot these as a histogram.
Compare distributions between selected regions or years to highlight differences.

## Monthly and seasonal drought patterns
Heat maps can visualize how drought conditions vary by month or season within a selected year. This is particularly useful for showing how drought develops or recedes over time, which can be crucial for understanding seasonal impacts on agriculture and water resources.

### Technical Implementation:
Organize SPEI data into a matrix format representing months or seasons.
Use color intensity to show the severity of drought conditions through the year.
