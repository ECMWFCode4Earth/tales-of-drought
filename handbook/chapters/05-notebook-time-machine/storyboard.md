# The time machine: identify drought events


## Purpose of the notebook
Explain the objective of the notebook, which is to recognize drought events around the world and over time.



## Indicators of interest
We will concentrate on the SPEI values from our dataset, covering the period from 1940 to the present. The data quality will be assessed, noting any limitations such as missing data or measurement errors that could influence our analysis.

## Data loading and preprocessing
- Getting the data: we will describe the source of our dataset, primarily focusing on the distribution of SPEI values in NetCDF format.
- Loading data: instructions on how to load these indices using Python libraries like xarray for handling multidimensional arrays.
- Data inspection: a walkthrough of the dataset’s structure, highlighting important variables, their dimensions, and accessing metadata.
- Preprocessing steps: necessary steps such as handling missing values, aligning time series data, and normalizing the indices will be covered.


## Drought over time
A line chart will display SPEI values over time to highlight trends, cycles, and anomalies in drought conditions, possibly with different lines for different locations or time scales.

## Selecting a year to explore
This segment will be designed as an interactive feature within the notebook where the audience can choose a specific year from the dataset to analyze. A dropdown menu or slider will be used for year selection. This interactive element will allow users to personalize the data exploration to their interests or specific years they might be curious about, such as years of significant global events like El Niño.

### Technical implementation
Utilize Python libraries like ipywidgets for interactive controls.
Upon selection, the notebook will dynamically load and process SPEI data for that particular year, preparing it for visualization and further analysis in subsequent sections.

## Distribution of drought conditions
Histograms will be used to show the distribution of SPEI scores across different regions or globally in the selected year. This will help illustrate how widespread severe drought conditions were and identify the most commonly occurring drought severity levels.

### Technical implementation:
Calculate the frequency of different SPEI categories (e.g., mild, moderate, severe, extreme) and plot these as a histogram.
Compare distributions between selected regions or years to highlight differences.


## Mapping drought globally
Once a year is selected, this section will generate a visual representation—typically a global map—illustrating the SPEI values across different regions. The map will use a color gradient to show varying degrees of drought severity; for instance, deep red will indicate extreme drought, while blue might indicate normal or wet conditions. The purpose here is to provide a clear, at-a-glance understanding of how different parts of the world were affected by drought in the selected year.

### Technical implementation
Use mapping libraries to create the global map.
Overlay SPEI data onto the map, using color coding to represent different drought intensities.


## Deep dive into specific regions
In this segment, the notebook will offer a closer look at specific regions that either experienced significant drought conditions or where drought had notable impacts on human or ecological systems during the selected year. This will involve a comparative analysis of regions with severe drought versus those with mild or no drought.

### Technical implementation:
Allow users to select regions on the global map for a more detailed analysis.
Display localized SPEI data and possibly integrate other data types.

## Comparison over time
This feature will enable users to understand how drought conditions have changed over time by comparing SPEI data between different years. Users will select another year to compare side-by-side with the initially selected year. This comparison will help illustrate trends such as the increasing frequency of droughts or shifts in drought-prone areas.

### Technical implementation:
Implement additional interactive controls to select a second year for comparison.
Use side-by-side or overlaid maps to visually compare drought conditions across the two selected years.
Optionally, statistical analysis will be performed to quantitatively describe changes in drought severity and coverage.


## Monthly and seasonal drought patterns
Heatmaps can visualize how drought conditions vary by month or season within a selected year. This is particularly useful for showing how drought develops or recedes over time, which can be crucial for understanding seasonal impacts on agriculture and water resources.

### Technical Implementation:
Organize SPEI data into a matrix format representing months or seasons.
Use color intensity to show the severity of drought conditions through the year.
