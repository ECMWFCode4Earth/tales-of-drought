# The netCDF files

Climate data often increase their size rapidly due to the need to analyze extensive periods and broad geographical regions. Consequently, it is impractical to store them in text-based formats like CSV or tabular files. Instead, climate data are typically stored in a binary format, which is not directly readable by humans.

One prevalent binary format for climate data is **netCDF**, which uses the **.nc** file extension. Since it is a binary format, specific software or libraries are required to manage these files.

Metadata can be stored using attributes within these files. For guidelines on what metadata to include.

- To learn more about netCDF data format read the [What are NetCDF files and how can I read them](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/What+are+NetCDF+files+and+how+can+I+read+them) guide by ECMWF.
- The [CF Conventions](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/cf-conventions.html#_description_of_the_data) serve as a valuable reference for climate data metadata.
