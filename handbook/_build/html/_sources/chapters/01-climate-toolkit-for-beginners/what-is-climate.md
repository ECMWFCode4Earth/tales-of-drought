# What is climate?

The terms "**climate**" and "**weather**" are often used interchangeably, but they hold distinctly different meanings for climate scientists. 

*Weather* describes atmospheric conditions over short periods, typically spanning hours to days. 

In contrast, **climate** refers to the average behavior of the atmosphere over much longer periods, ranging from years to decades, and sometimes even centuries. Typically, climatologists use a **30-year period** as a standard to gather robust statistics and maintain stable climate conditions.

Between the scales of weather and climate lies the concept of **climate variability**, also known as climate **anomaly**. This measures the deviations of a particular season's or year's condition from the climatological average for that period.

The choice of data — whether focusing on weather, climate or climate variability — depends on the specific research question being addressed. For our drought analysis, we will consider only climate and climate variability data.
