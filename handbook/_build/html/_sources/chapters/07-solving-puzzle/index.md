# Solving the puzzle: determine drivers of the drought

## Purpose of the notebook
Explain the objective of the notebook, which is identifying and exploring the primary drivers of drought conditions, specifically focusing on the roles of precipitation deficits and temperature extremes.


## Recap of Notebook 1 and 2
Quick summary of what was covered: 
- Notebook 1: methods used to identify drought events globally using SPI and SPEI data.
- Notebook 2: techniques for evaluating the severity and anomalies of droughts.


## Conceptual overview:
- Define what constitutes a driver in the context of climatic events.
- Discuss the hydrological and meteorological factors contributing to droughts.
- Explain how changes in precipitation and temperature interact to exacerbate or mitigate drought conditions.


## Indicators of interest
- Brief description of the specific variables in the dataset that will be used for analysis.
- Data quality and limits (if there are any).


## Analyzing precipitation trends
### Trend analysis:
- Plot long-term precipitation trends.
- Identify periods of significant deviations from historical norms.

### Correlation with drought events:
- Map precipitation trends against identified drought periods from notebook 1.
- Statistical analysis to correlate low precipitation with the onset of droughts.


## Exploring temperature influences

### Temperature trends:
- Visualize trends in temperature data over the same period.
- Highlight extreme temperature events.

### Impact assessment:
- Analyze how temperature extremes coincide with drought conditions.
- Use statistical models to assess the impact of high temperatures on drought severity, considering evapotranspiration rates included in the SPEI.


##  Integrated Analysis

### Combining data:
- Integrate precipitation and temperature data to see the combined effect on drought indices.
- Use scatter plots and regression analysis to examine the relationships between these variables and drought conditions.

### Case study:
- Select the specific historical drought event used in the previous notebooks.
- Analyze precipitation and temperature data to narrate the story of this drought event.
- Discuss whether this drought event were driven more by lack of precipitation, temperature extremes, or a combination of both.

## Conclusion

- Summarize key insights on how precipitation and temperature interplay to cause droughts.
- Define the limitations of the data and methods used.
- Discuss potential variables not considered that could influence drought assessment (e.g., global climatic phenomena like El Ni√±o).
- How can this information help?
