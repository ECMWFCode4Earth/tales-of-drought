# The time machine: identify drought events


## Purpose of the notebook
Monitoring drought in Madagascar, particularly in its southern regions, is crucial due to the significant impact on the local environment and communities. The island nation, located off the southeast coast of Africa, often faces periods of severe drought, which can drastically affect its agricultural productivity and food security.

Environmental and climatic data are used to monitor drought. Rainfall patterns, soil moisture levels, and temperature variations are all critical factors in assessing drought severity. These data help in understanding the underlying causes of drought and predicting future trends.

The impact of drought in Madagascar extends beyond agriculture. It affects water availability, health, and overall livelihoods of the local population. Therefore, continuous monitoring and analysis are necessary to develop effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This comprehensive approach enables stakeholders, including government agencies and international organizations, to respond promptly and effectively to drought conditions, minimizing their adverse effects on the population and the environment.
